# TabularMark
This repository implements experiments for TabularMark. The idea is to perturb a small proportion of cells in a tabular dataset to embed watermarks.

## Dataset
The datasets used in the experiments can be downloaded from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vyxfkSLTXuDdB1UD2KpSgKFShXrbRHbQ/view?usp=drive_link). After downloading `datasets.zip`, unzip it and place the `dataset` folder in the TabularMark directory.


## Usage
All the experimental code is located in the `/experiments` directory. Each experiment is contained in its respective folder. To run an experiment, simply navigate to the appropriate directory and execute the scripts. 

For example, to run `experiment1`:
```bash
cd experiments/experiment1
python script1.py
```

There are also some experimental codes in Jupyter Notebook scripts. You can run each cell according to the annotations to obtain the results.
